# GitHub Action: Create Zip on all-the-bufo Folder Changes
#
# Purpose:
#   This workflow automatically creates a zip archive of the 'all-the-bufo' folder
#   whenever changes are detected in that directory.
#
# Trigger:
#   - Runs on push events that modify files in the 'all-the-bufo/**' path
#   - Only triggers on the default branch (main/master)
#
# Output:
#   - Creates an artifact named 'all-the-bufo.zip' containing all files from the folder
#   - Artifact is available for download from the Actions tab for 90 days
#
# Maintenance Notes:
#   - To change the artifact retention period, modify the 'retention-days' parameter
#   - To include additional folders, add more paths to the 'paths' filter
#   - The zip file preserves the directory structure starting from 'all-the-bufo/'
